# Iterations

From the design to creation of Studbud, iterations on the concept and layouts were considered. This was with consideration of the time to create the application. Overall, the design was simplified, to ensure all the basic needs were completed. The level of detail and functionality was also considered, and most functionalities provide a level of dynamic interaction capabilities, which could easily and broadly be built upon. Parts of the application have been hardcoded due to time constraints and the planned level of functionality. However, some sections have been more deeply considered or ‘soft coded’.

# Future

Kanban Board could have more features such as being able to assign the subjects added to the created card. Upon this more of the application should be editable, which would be easily implemented with the current data construction.
